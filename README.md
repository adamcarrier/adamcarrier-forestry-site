# Personal site Forestry.io theme

Hi there! This repo contains the template files for my personal [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) site at [AdamCarrier.com](https://adamcarrier.com/). It uses a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme based on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme of the same name. Just seemed like a good starting theme.

FWIW, my personal site is deployed and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
