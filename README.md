# Personal site Forestry.io theme

Hi there! This repo contains the template files for my personal [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) site at [AdamCarrier.com](https://adamcarrier.com/). It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and a modified copy of the [Anatole theme](https://github.com/wjburton/anatole).

FWIW, my personal site is deployed and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
